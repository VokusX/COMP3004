# Microcurrent Biofeedback Device Simulation Device

GitHub was used for version control for our project. The repo can be found at: https://github.com/VokusX/COMP3004

The folder structure of the project is as follows: 
- Documentation.pdf contains the Use Cases and the associated diagrams and goes into depth about the implementation details for the project
- /Documentation contains the raw files that we used to compile the PDF
- /Final contains the source code for the project

To run the simulator, open the MenuInterface.pro file from the /Final folder in QT Creator and Build the project.
